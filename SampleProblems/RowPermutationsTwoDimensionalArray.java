/* 
Given a 2-dimensional array of positive integers and a row number,
find all the rows in the matrix which are permutations of the given row.
It is also given that the values in every row are distinct.

Example Input: arr[][] = {{3, 1, 4, 2},
                          {1, 6, 9, 3},
                          {1, 2, 3, 4},
                          {4, 3, 2, 1}}
               row = 3

Example Output: 0, 2
Because the rows at index 0 and 2 are valid permutations of the row at index 3.
