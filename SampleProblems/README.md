# Samples

A collection of real-world interview problems I have encountered.

For some interviews a live code editor (such as [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/)) will be used. For others, the interviewer wants to see well-written code but it won't actually be compiled or run. And at the other end of the spectrum, some interviewers only want to see pseudo-code demonstrating you understand the problem and a solution to it.

The sample problems in this section do not include solutions, but are presented to help think about the kinds of problems to expect and prepare for. Some problems clearly have a particular data structure or algorithm in mind for the solution, while others could have multiple valid solutions.

In some cases, an interview will feature a problem pulled straight from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) or one that is extremely similar; I have tried not to include those problems in this section.
