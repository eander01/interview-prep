# Technical Interviews

This repository is a consolidation of problems for algorithm-based technical interviews.

## [Problems](https://github.com/eander01/InterviewPrep/tree/main/Problems)

These problems are generally broken down by where they come from, and then either by book chapter, problem number, or category, or some combination depending on the best match for the original source structure.

The current problem sources are:

* Algorithm Patterns generally coming from [14 Patterns to Ace Any Coding Interview Question](https://hackernoon.com/14-patterns-to-ace-any-coding-interview-question-c5bb3357f6ed)
* [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) by [Gayle Laakmann McDowell](https://www.gayle.com/)
* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)
