# Resources

* Books
  * [Cracking the Coding Interview (CtCI)](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)
    * Probably the most used and most referenced resource for good reason.
    * The author provides quick chapters that cover the essentials along with a wealth of practice problems.
    * Due to the age of the book, the chapter on System Design seems insufficient in 2021 (in my experience there has been a shift away from OO style questions to more distributed systems, web architecture type of questions).
    * The author additionally has a series of videos on Youtube done in collaboration with HackerRank.
      * [Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI1t_8YX-Apv-UiRlnZwqqrRT8D1RhriX)
      * [Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI1t_8YX-ApvMthLj56t1Rf-Buio5Y8KL)
  * [Mindset: The New Psychology of Success](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322)
    * This book has had a huge impact on me even outside of this process.
    * Worth reading or at least grabbing key ideas from if you haven't ever considered a growth mindset vs a fixed mindset, or if you find yourself struggling with imposter syndrome, feelings of insufficiency, anxiety, fear, etc.
* [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com)
  * In general I found LeetCode to be superior to other similar sites, both in terms of the quantity and quality of problems as well as the amount of discussion and size of the community.
  * HackerRank has very limited support for C#, which made a difference at least in my case.
* YouTube Channels
  * Some of these are better than others but I found them all useful and quality content at times.

  * [An Algorithm for Passing Programming Interviews](https://malisper.me/an-algorithm-for-passing-programming-interviews/)
  * [Big-O Cheat Sheet](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)
  * [What is Big O Notation](https://jarednielsen.com/big-o-notation/)
  * [Sean Prashad - LeetCode Patterns](https://github.com/SeanPrashad/leetcode-patterns)
  * [The Daily Byte](https://thedailybyte.dev/) - Done by Kevin Naughton Jr in the Youtube section above. These were a helpful onramp from easier to more challenging problems for me.

* System Design
  * [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
  * [This is My Architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/this-is-my-architecture/) - These are very AWS-centric but are still great short videos to familiarize yourself with different architecture examples.
  * [Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview) - I ended up paying for an Educative.io subscription for one month to unlock this full course, which I think was worth it.
  * [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) - Great for whiteboarding and system design practice.
  * [StackExchange Performance](https://stackexchange.com/performance) - At least one helpful "real world" reference.

* IDE
  * In general the recommendation I followed and that I think makes the most sense is to solve problems on paper or a plain text editor as you won't be able to rely on IDE features in most actual interviews.
  * It is useful in some cases to be able to run tests against actual code and compile things, so figure out a setup that works for whatever language you are practicing in.
  * I had a Visual Studio solution available if I really needed to run some tests against something, but ended up using VS Code for most of my daily code practice and note-taking.
