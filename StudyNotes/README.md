## Getting Started

> "What any person in the world can learn, _almost_ all persons can learn, _if_ provided with the appropriate prior and current conditions of learning." - Dr. Carol Dweck, from the book _Mindset_

1. **Set a specific goal:** "I want to work at company X, or a company like X, by date Y". This can change over time, but it is helpful to be targeted and measured in your time usage as you begin.

2. **Build a roadmap to get from where you are now to where you want to be.** Depending on your level of familiarity with some of these topics, this roadmap could be as detailed as working through a long list of data structures and algorithms, or as pointed as doing a couple of practice interviews and reviewing key concepts.

3. If you do not already have one, **pick a specific programming language to use for your preparation.** When you go to interview, you will be asked what language you want to use. You want to be very comfortable with the syntax and data structures available to you in your chosen language, as well as understanding other important languages features. It is recommended to pick a language that is widely-used and has some basic library support for common data structures. Some good choices are:
   - Java (if unsure, pick this or Python)
   - Python
   - C# (this can be a good choice over Java if you are targeting companies in the Windows ecosystem)
   - C++ (particularly if interested in companies that favor lower-level languages)
   - JavaScript (particularly if interested in front-end roles)
   - Other languages that could make sense given your particular goals: Go, Kotlin, Rust, Ruby, Swift, etc.

4. **Work with others**. In particular, having other experienced engineers that you can ask questions of, practice with, or discuss concepts with is very helpful and can save a lot of time trying to learn new things or discover your unknown-unknowns. Ideally these would be real-world connections, but in the absence of these kinds of relationships, there are a number of online communities where you can participate and discuss with others.

5. **Be intentional and strategic in your preparation**. This is a broad topic, but here are a few suggestions:
   - There are an almost limitless number of technical resources online of varying degrees of quality. Rather than trying to drink from a firehose or gain a comprehensive breadth of knowledge on all subjects, take the time to identify the ideas that are truly important to master and focus on utilizing high-quality resources in those areas.
   - Don't try to memorize things. Instead, look for and learn patterns and concepts.
   - Data Structures are usually more important than Algorithms. Understanding how data structures work, how they are implemented in your chosen language, and when they are used will allow you to determine the appropriate data structure for the appropriate problem. Once the correct data structure is in place, the necessary algorithm will often be readily apparent.
   - Try and study and practice for shorter lengths of time regularly instead of longer lengths of time irregularly.

6. **Setup your environment and tools**. You will want to ensure you have the following:
   - A text editor with syntax support for your chosen programming language.
      - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular and strong choice.
      - You will be using your text editor for most of your practice problems. In an actual interview, it is unlikely you will use an actual IDE. A text editor with syntax highlighting but without auto-completion and some of the built-in features of a full IDE is a close simulation for real-world interviews.
      - In the past it may have been suggested to do coding problems with pencil and paper to more closely simulate white-boarding interviews, but in the post-COVID world of remote interviews, you will likely be doing all of your interviewing in an environment such as [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/).
   - A note-taking system and appropriate tools.
      - If you don't already have a good system in place for taking notes, this could be an opportunity to begin developing one.
      - Writing things down is an important part of the learning process, and as you study and take notes you will quickly end up with a helpful collection of resources to review or share with others.
      - I personally really like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but this can be a very personal choice to find something that works well for you.
   - (Recommended) An IDE or the ability to compile / interpret code.
      - The important goal here is to have the ability to do things like run unit tests, print statements, or debug code.
      - You do not want to do most of your practice in this manner, but it can be a very helpful way to go more in-depth on particular problems as needed.
      - The desired setup would be to have a stubbed out unit test or runnable file where you can quickly paste some code and then see what it does. This is very helpful when you are struggling to see how a solution works, or want to step line by line through an algorithm.
      - If you are using an interpreted language such as Python, VS Code will have excellent extensions available to you. If you are using Java, [IntelliJ IDEA Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) is a great place to start. If you are using C#, then [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) is a high-quality and free option.
   - (Optional) Some people find spaced-repetition flash card programs, such as [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/about) to be very useful.

## Data Structures

> "If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to progamming." -Rob Pike, [5 Rules of Programming](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/pike.html)

### Section Goals

The goals for this section are to be able to:

- [ ] Identify and talk about each of the major data structures.
- [ ] Loosely implement each of the major data structures in your chosen language.
- [ ] Identify and explain the Big O time and space complexity for each of the major data structures.
- [ ] Choose the correct data structure(s) to use for solving a given problem.

### Major Data Structures

The following are the most important data structures to be familiar with. Of these, particular attention should be given to Maps and Arrays, as many problems are solved with these two structures alone.

_Note:_ There is some variance in naming convention in this list based on the language you are using. I have tried to use the more general term, or include multiple terms where it would be helpful. I have also tried to split sections out where helpful, despite some of these structures being built on top of others (ex: `Queue` in Java is an Interface which `LinkedList` implements).

- Arrays, Lists, and Strings
- HashTables
- LinkedLists
- Queues and Stacks
- Trees and Graphs
